# HIL Evidence Summary

This file preserves the useful facts from removed raw HIL runner artifacts.
The deleted artifacts were working transcripts, JSON dumps, stdout/stderr files,
PID files, and prompt-driven reports. They were large and not needed in the
release tree.

## Fixture

- Host: Windows 11, Python 3.12.10, PySerial 3.5.
- Port: `COM27`, baud `115200`.
- Firmware profile: Arduino `examples/01_basic_bringup_cli`.
- MCU/board: ESP32-S3, PlatformIO `esp32s3dev`.
- I2C: SDA 8, SCL 9, 400 kHz, 50 ms Wire timeout.
- Detected I2C devices during the first run: `0x3C`, `0x50`, `0x51`.
- Detected FRAM on all preserved runs: `MB85RC64TA`, Device ID raw `00 A3 58`,
  manufacturer `0x00A`, product `0x358`, capacity 8192 bytes.

These runs are evidence for this MB85RC64TA ESP32-S3 fixture only. They are not
MB85RC256V production-readiness evidence.

## Runs

| Date | Duration | Gate | Functional | Soak | Final health | Heap | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-06-22/23 | 8 h | non-strict | 26 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 UNKNOWN | 53191 PASS / 0 FAIL / 30 UNKNOWN | READY, consecutive failures 0, total failures 0 | not exposed | Completed full duration with bounded serial/prompt UNKNOWN windows. |
| 2026-06-23 | 2 min | strict PASS | 29 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 UNKNOWN | 219 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 UNKNOWN | READY, consecutive failures 0, total failures 0 | baseline 344040, final 343784, min 340976 | Strict runner, heap command present, no resets or reconnects. |
| 2026-06-23/24 | 20 h | strict FAIL | 29 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 UNKNOWN | 142816 PASS / 0 FAIL / 69 UNKNOWN | READY, consecutive failures 0, total failures 0 | baseline 344040, final 343784, min 340976 | Strict failed only because UNKNOWN count was nonzero; no FAIL, no target reset, no serial reconnect. |

## 20-Hour UNKNOWN Breakdown

The 20-hour strict soak classified 69 command windows as UNKNOWN. The runner
continued without reconnecting, later command cycles passed, final driver health
was clean, and firmware-level pass/fail counters stayed at zero after the next
complete command output.

| Command | Count | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `probe` | 36 | Host serial/prompt capture timed out before a complete command window. |
| `xfer_demo` | 19 | Partial restore-safe PASS output was captured, then the command window timed out. Later cycles passed and restored the scratch range. |
| `rw_suite` | 11 | Partial PASS output was captured, then the command window timed out. Later cycles passed. |
| `crc` | 2 | Host capture timeout. |
| `drv` | 1 | Host capture timeout. |

The practical diagnosis was PC-side serial/prompt framing under long soak load,
not a demonstrated FRAM data, firmware, reset, or driver-health failure.

## Production Evidence Still Not Run

- MB85RC256V hardware HIL.
- ESP32-S2 hardware HIL.
- Native ESP-IDF hardware HIL and local `idf.py` builds; `idf.py` was not on
  PATH during the recorded validation.
- Fault-injection HIL: wrong address/missing device, WP-high behavior,
  controlled power cycle/brownout, address-strap matrix, and shared-bus
  behavior.
